# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity,
or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
* Focusing on the betterment of the community
* Demonstrating empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments; personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct.
